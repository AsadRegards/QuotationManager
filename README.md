## ü§ñ AI Involvement

This project was heavily assisted by **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) during development:
- ~80% of the code was generated with the help of AI prompts.

This project showcases how AI tools can enhance developer productivity while maintaining full control and customisation over application logic.
